**Objective:** Develop an autonomous TurtleBot3 system for urban search and rescue operations using SLAM, computer vision, and beacon detection.

This advanced robotics project implements a complete autonomous navigation and search system using ROS2. The TurtleBot3 robot autonomously explores an unknown maze environment while simultaneously building a map (SLAM), detecting colored beacons representing "victims," and publishing real-time location data for rescue coordination.

**Key Features:**

- **Multi-Topic Publishing:** Real-time data streams for map, path, and beacon locations
- **Marker Visualization:** RViz integration for visual feedback and monitoring

**Technical Implementation:**
- **SLAM Navigation:** Autonomous exploration with obstacle avoidance
- **Image Processing:** HSV color space filtering for beacon detection (4 unique color combinations)
- **Coordinate Transformation:** Camera frame to map frame coordinate conversion
- **Custom Message Protocol:** Header timestamps, sequence numbering, and position data

### 2. **Design and Simulation of a Robotic Manipulator for Automated Assembly**
**Duration:** Aug 2023 ‚Äì Oct 2023  
**Objective:** Automate nut-and-bolt operations using a 6-DOF manipulator.

This project focuses on the complete design, simulation, and control of a robotic manipulator for an automated assembly task. The system uses Denavit‚ÄìHartenberg (D-H) parameters to define joint transformations and compute both forward and inverse kinematics. The robot is programmed to pick and place M3 screws, demonstrating precision control and path planning.

**Key Features:**
- 6-DOF robot model with revolute and prismatic joints
- Forward and inverse kinematics
- Jacobian analysis for velocity control
- Path planning and sequence animation using `drawrobot3d()`
- Real-time trajectory interpolation for screw handling

**Skills Demonstrated:** MATLAB, Robotics Toolbox, Kinematics, Jacobians, Path Planning, Animation

### 3. **Design and Optimization of a Tuned Mass Damper (TMD) System for Vehicle Suspension**
**Duration:** Sep 2023 ‚Äì Oct 2023  
**Objective:** Reduce vibrations in vehicle suspension systems using passive damping.

This project simulates a two-mass spring-damper system to study and suppress unwanted oscillations in a vehicle-like structure. The primary and secondary masses are dynamically coupled, and numerical simulation via MATLAB's `ode45` reveals vibration behavior and effectiveness of the tuned mass damper.

**Key Features:**
- 2-DOF system modeled with spring-damper coupling
- External force excitation applied to the primary mass
- Numerical integration using Runge-Kutta (ODE45)
- Plots for displacement and velocity of both masses
- Parameter tuning for optimal damping response

**Skills Demonstrated:** System Modeling, Vibration Analysis, Damping Optimization, MATLAB Simulation

### 4. **Vibration Control and Optimization of a Flatbed Trolley Using PID Control**
**Duration:** Apr 2024 ‚Äì May 2024  
**Objective:** Design a digital PID controller for a flatbed trolley to minimize vibration.

This project implements an advanced control system using tuned PID gains to reduce vibration in a flatbed trolley. Starting with a mass-spring-damper model, the system is represented by a transfer function. A continuous PID controller is tuned, analyzed using Bode plots and root locus, and then discretized using Zero-Order Hold (ZOH) for digital control. Performance metrics like overshoot, settling time, and stability are evaluated.

**Key Features:**
- Transfer function representation of physical system
- Tuned PID controller (Kp, Ki, Kd)
- Conversion to discrete-time control system
- Sampling rate derived from system bandwidth
- Stability check (pole analysis inside unit circle)
- Step response and performance metric plots

**Skills Demonstrated:** Control Systems, PID Tuning, System Discretization, MATLAB & Signal Processing
